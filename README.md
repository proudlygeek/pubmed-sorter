PubMed Sorter
=============

The name says it all: A software which sorts and exports plain txt pubmed records quickly.

Why use plain txt anyway?
-------------------------

This little project started because a friend of mine needed an hand on sorting *literally* millions of PubMed saved into several txt files.
Initially this was a simple script which turned into a GUI later.
I Hope someone else can find this code/app useful.

Why the code is so poor?
-------------------------

Well, it was coded in *four* days. Oh, it's also because of my limited skills with the Qt Library (My first "experiment").
